# Atif Shaikh's personal website
This is my personal website I made as an assignment and hopefully to oneday market myself with.
It has a sunset color theme with a clean design and responsive design 

# Features
## Overall responsive design
- entire website responds to window width smoothly

## Navigation Bar
- navigation bar shrinks with size
- once small enough will transition to a drop down format

## Portfolio
- has tabs to filter different projects build with different technologies
- filters the project cards and changes size and background color

# Upcoming Features
- currently the links to the resume and linkedin do not work intentionally as they are not ready yet, will work when they are done
- project cards do not link to projects yet as I still have to curate and put projects on github
- transition portfolio to a swipe left and right model once sufficiently small
